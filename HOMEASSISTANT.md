# Home Assistant entity configurations
If you use [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/), here's a preconfigured list of all the MQTT sensors, to help you get started.

However, all inverter data is sent to a MQTT server of your choosing.
In no way you are required to run [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) to access it.

## Live data sensors (all data from input registers)
These sensors are what you'll need to get the data from the inverter in Home Assistant.

## Settings (to change the holding registers)
You'll need this if you want to make changes to the inverter, from Home Assistant.

## Dashboards
To get you started really quickly and reduce the amount of editing on your Home Assistant, below is a simplified dashboard, based on the one I have on my own Home Assistant to display all the entities from the inverter data.

              Clicking the button below will trigger a sync of the current
              inverter state to this dashboard.

              The following MQTT event will be published:
              **growatt/settings/priority status**. 


              No changes are sent to the inverter.
